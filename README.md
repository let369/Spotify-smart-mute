# Spotify smart mute
Since the recent update Spotify web player ads are not blocked by chrome extensions like ADBlock, Ghostery etc.<br/> 
This is a new chrome extension that simply mutes Spotify tabs when advertisements start to play.<br>

For users that are annoyed by the ads instead of muting manually and checking when the ads finished to unmute this process has been automated.
Hopefully this doesn't violate any rights as the ads pass as required.<br>

The extension offers from the popup an easy access enable/disable switch.<br>
